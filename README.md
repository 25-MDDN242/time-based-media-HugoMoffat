## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README

Sketch idea:
rod/bars/blocks rotate at fourths in batteries. The position of the rods tells the time. if a rod is pointing up it has no value.
    - first four (left to right) are hours, if the fourth rod is pointing down, it is 11:00.
    - second and third batteries have 5 rods. top two are for the first digit, bottom three are the second.
        - second rod in the second battery is pointing down its __:50 | fifth rod pointing right makes it __:57
        - first rod in the third battery is pointing left its __:__:30 | second rod pointing down its __:__:35
    - all together it is 11:57.35
